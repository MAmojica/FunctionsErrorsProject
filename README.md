Overview
This Solidity smart contract, ExampleContract, demonstrates the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements to manage conditions, enforce invariants, and handle errors in Ethereum smart contracts.

Contract Functionality
Contract Deployment
The contract initializes with the following:

owner: The address that deploys the contract becomes the owner.
balance: Initial balance is set to 0.
Functions
deposit()

Description: Allows users to deposit Ether into the contract.
Usage: Call this function with a positive value of Ether to add funds to the contract balance.
Requirements: Requires the deposited value to be greater than zero.
withdraw(uint amount)

Description: Allows the contract owner to withdraw Ether from the contract balance.
Usage: Only the contract owner can call this function to withdraw a specified amount of Ether.
Requirements: Requires the caller to be the contract owner and ensures that the contract has sufficient balance for withdrawal.
testAssert()

Description: Tests the assert() statement.
Usage: View function that checks an invariant condition (balance should always be non-negative) using assert().
triggerRevert()

Description: Demonstrates the revert() statement.
Usage: Pure function that intentionally triggers a revert with a custom error message.
resetContract()

Description: Allows the contract owner to reset the contract state.
Usage: Only the contract owner can call this function to reset the contract balance to zero.
Error Handling
require(): Used throughout the contract to enforce pre-conditions (e.g., valid input values, ownership).
assert(): Used to check for invariants (e.g., ensuring the balance is non-negative).
revert(): Used for intentional error triggering with custom error messages.
Usage
Deploy the contract on a test network or local blockchain.
Interact with the contract using wallet applications or through scripts.
Use deposit() to add funds, withdraw() to retrieve funds, testAssert() to check invariants, and triggerRevert() to observe revert behavior.
Only the contract owner can reset the contract state using resetContract().
Security Considerations
Ensure that only trusted addresses interact with critical functions like withdraw() and resetContract().
Test the contract thoroughly on test networks before deploying to the mainnet.
Consider adding additional security features such as access control mechanisms depending on the specific use case.
